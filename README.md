# Hey there! 👋🏻

My name is Shelton and I'm currently learning Swift and iOS development. I'm a native of Tennessee but I currently live in Kansas City. I'm a walking encyclopedia of The Office, and I'm a big Arsenal fan.

My interests as a developer include: 

- Protecting user privacy (I draw inspiration from projects like Signal, Tor, and DuckDuckGo)
- Enhancing mobile experiences for medical professionals, making them more efficient for their patients
- Creating mobile resources for low-income communities
