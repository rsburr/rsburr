# Hey there! 👋🏻

My name is Shelton and I'm currently learning Swift and iOS development. I'm a native of Tennessee but I currently live in Kansas City. I'm a walking encyclopedia of The Office, and I'm a big Arsenal fan. 

_Ask me what I think of Tottenham..._ 😅

My interests as a developer include ethical software that protects user privacy, as well as developing resources for low-income communities that keep them connected to essential community services.
